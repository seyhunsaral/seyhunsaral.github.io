title: Announcing my blog!
---

Documentation, Stackoverflow and Blogs... These are the modern times' books. 
I learn things from other (and mostly random) people's blogs on a daily basis. 
Even better, sometimes I get to learn about those inspiting people. 
So, to be concise, it has been a while since I would like to create a blog and to be 
a random person somebody might get a tiny bit of information or trick from. So here 
it is. 

I used Jeykll now because I like the confort of Markdown. And I use Jeykll Now on Github
instead of using my own website because I might change servers, to busy to deal with my webpage,
or even forget to update my payment information. Then things on Github or on the other git 
repos will probably have a higher lifespan. They are also easier to archive. 

So here it is, my new blog. Hopefully it might be helpful for someone.
