title: Announcing my blog!
---

I have been learning things from some other -and most of the time random- people's blogs on a daily basis. It has been a 
while since I planned to have one on my own which I can share some small tips and tricks and maybe updates that might be 
interesting for other people. Hopefully I cam be that random person for somebody as well. 

To give technical details, I used Jeykll because I like writing in markdown. And it is hosted on GitHub instead of my own webserver because I might be changing servers, to busy to deal with my webpage, or even forget to update my payment information. It is probaly easier to archive things like that. Here you can find more informatin about Jekyll Now: https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now
