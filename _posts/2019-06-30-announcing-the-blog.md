title: Announcing my blog!
---

I have been learning things from some other -and most of the time random- people's blogs on a daily basis. So I decided to have one on my own, which I can share some small tips and tricks. Maybe also updates that might be 
interesting for other people. 

Hopefully, I can be that random person that helped you, once in a while.

To give technical details about this blog, I used `Jeykll` because I like writing in markdown. And it is hosted on GitHub instead of my own webserver because I might be changing servers time to time, might be too busy to deal with my webpage, or even forget to update my payment information. Plus, it is probably easier to archive things in this way. 

I used Jeykll Now for the integration. Here you can find more informatin about Jekyll Now: https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now 

That's all for now. 

Best,
ali seyhun
